|`8`|**Incident Analysis & Resolution** | I received a call for a system issue in the afternoon on 13th March 2021. The system issue, it was coming out that the USB port of the system stopped working automatically. Then we checked but the issue was not resolved. Then we called Dell customer care no. and had a conversation with a Dell technical person saying the system was motherboard part issue, then they are complaints locked for part replacement. We finally locked the components in the Dell care for this problem on 15th March 2021. But Dell took some time to solve this problem, due to which we faced the problem then we mailed again then found out He said sorry sir, we are sorry for this, due to Corona it is taking some time to get this part. But we will try to solve your problem as soon as possible. Finally on 25th March 2021 the Dell engineers came with the motherboard part and the problem was resolved.|
